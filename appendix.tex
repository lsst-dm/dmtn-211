\faro is also available as part of the LSST Science Pipelines Docker images available via Docker Hub (\url{https://hub.docker.com/r/lsstsqre/centos/}).
\faro includes a Python API and can be run from the command line via the LSST Science Pipelines. 
The documentation can be found online at \url{https://pipelines.lsst.io/faro}

\section{Faro Tutorial}
An online tutorial demonstrating use of \faro via the Python API can be found at (URL).
This tutorial takes as input, processed X data and computes a variety of metrics on the processed data products. 
Additionally, the tutorial exposes the use of several other components of the LSST Science Pipelines, notable the PipelineTask framework for <> (reference) and the Data Butler that abstracts access to the data  (ref Tim's paper)
