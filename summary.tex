\noindent \textbf{100 word summary} \newline
\noindent Once operational, up to 20TB of raw imaging data will be collected by Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) per night and processed by the LSST Science Pipelines to produce science-ready data products -- processed images, catalogs and alerts.  
To ensure that these data products enable transformative science with LSST, stringent requirements have been placed on their quality and scientific fidelity.
In this paper we introduce {\ttfamily faro}, a framework for automatically and efficiently computing scientific performance metrics on the LSST data products for units of data of varying granularity, ranging from single-detector to full-survey summary statistics.
